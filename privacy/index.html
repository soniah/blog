<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<h2 style="color: #014421;">Privacy Policy for www.snowfrog.net</h2>

The privacy of our visitors to www.snowfrog.net is important to us.

At www.snowfrog.net, we recognize that privacy of your personal information is
important. Here is information on what types of personal information we receive
and collect when you use and visit www.snowfrog.net, and how we safeguard your

<h2 style="color: #014421;">Log Files</h2>

As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log
files. The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol)
address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as Telstra or Internode),
the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox),

We also use third party advertisements on www.snowfrog.net to support our

geotargeting purposes (showing Sydney real estate ads to someone in Sydney, for
example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as
showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party
cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such
