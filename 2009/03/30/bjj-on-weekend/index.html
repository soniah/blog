      <h1 class="post-title">BJJ on Weekend</h1>
        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> 30 Mar 2009 </h5>
          <p>This weekend I had a BJJ competition &ndash; the &ldquo;6th Annual Australian Submission Grappling Championships&rdquo; (what a mouthful) &ndash; here are some videos from the weekend.</p>

<p>The competition went all day and I didn&rsquo;t get as many videos as usual as I was one of the officials too (table scorer).</p>

<p>*(For those of you who don&rsquo;t know what [BJJ][1] is (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) &ndash; here&rsquo;s a short history: at the start of 1900&rsquo;s <strong>in Japan ** <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo">Judo</a> split off as a sport from the more traditional Japanese warrior arts or Jiu-Jitsu. At about the same time there was a large wave of Japanese migration to Brazil. A family called &lsquo;Gracie&rsquo; adapted and changed Jiu-Jitsu until it was fairly different from the Japanese version. Due to the success of the Brazilian form of Jiu-Jitsu in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufc">UFC</a> competitions in the 1990s, it was realised that **grappling skills (eg Judo, BJJ, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art)">Sambo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankration">Pankration</a>) are just as important</strong> as striking skills (eg boxing, kick boxing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_thai">Muay Thai</a>) (pretty obvious to anyone who&rsquo;s seen a headlock in a bar/street fight) &ndash; hence the increase in popularity of BJJ. As to which martial art is &ldquo;the best&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll leave that to the arm-chair fighters in the forums &ndash; any martial art is good, as long as you train consistently over a long period &ndash; &ldquo;3 months of xyz 5 years ago&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t really cut it. And of course the best self defence is to not get into a dangerous situation or fight in the first place &ndash; by being aware of your surroundings, not getting drunk and obnoxious, keeping your ego in check when things get tense, and runninggggggg when push comes to shove.).<br />
*</p>

<p>My injuries have been playing up and I&rsquo;ve had the flu on and off for a month (arghh), so whilst I won both my grapples on points I wasn&rsquo;t really on top of my game and I didn&rsquo;t get any submissions :-( In both the grapples I was against smaller, more junior competitors so it wasn&rsquo;t really fair on them, but none of the senior women entered &ndash; get off your as** and compete!!</p>

<p>My first grapple &ndash; versus a Moari woman from Boxing Works/Nova Uniao &ndash; she&rsquo;s stocky and strong and being so short it was hard for me to get under her and take her down; but once we were down I just played my game &ndash; thanks Dan.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>My second grapple &ndash; versus Karla from my own team. She&rsquo;s only been training for about 9 months but she did really well and I think she&rsquo;ll be a good grappler in the future. She&rsquo;s also a capoeirista, and it shows it her footwork.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>Some other grapples:</p>

<p>Genevieve from my team (green top and leggings) &ndash; she&rsquo;s new but it&rsquo;s really great that she&rsquo;s entering competitions &ndash; they&rsquo;re pretty daunting for a beginner. She was in the lighter weight division.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>Just us (nervously) mucking around before going onto the mat. Like always, the waiting is the worst &ndash; butterflies, you feel ill, suddenly need to &ldquo;visit the bathroom&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>Jason, a beginner from my team &ndash; he ripped his ear <em>again</em> and bled everywhere. Dude, wear headgear.</p>
