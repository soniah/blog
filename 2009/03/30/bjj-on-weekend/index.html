        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> 30 Mar 2009 </h5>
          <p>This weekend I had a BJJ competition &#8211; the &#8220;6th Annual Australian Submission Grappling Championships&#8221; (what a mouthful) &#8211; here are some videos from the weekend.</p>

<p>The competition went all day and I didn&#8217;t get as many videos as usual as I was one of the officials too (table scorer).</p>

<p>*(For those of you who don&#8217;t know what [BJJ][1] is (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) &#8211; here&#8217;s a short history: at the start of 1900&#8217;s <strong>in Japan ** <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo">Judo</a> split off as a sport from the more traditional Japanese warrior arts or Jiu-Jitsu. At about the same time there was a large wave of Japanese migration to Brazil. A family called &#8216;Gracie&#8217; adapted and changed Jiu-Jitsu until it was fairly different from the Japanese version. Due to the success of the Brazilian form of Jiu-Jitsu in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ufc">UFC</a> competitions in the 1990s, it was realised that **grappling skills (eg Judo, BJJ, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art)">Sambo</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pankration">Pankration</a>) are just as important</strong> as striking skills (eg boxing, kick boxing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_thai">Muay Thai</a>) (pretty obvious to anyone who&#8217;s seen a headlock in a bar/street fight) &#8211; hence the increase in popularity of BJJ. As to which martial art is &#8220;the best&#8221;, I&#8217;ll leave that to the arm-chair fighters in the forums &#8211; any martial art is good, as long as you train consistently over a long period &#8211; &#8220;3 months of xyz 5 years ago&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really cut it. And of course the best self defence is to not get into a dangerous situation or fight in the first place &#8211; by being aware of your surroundings, not getting drunk and obnoxious, keeping your ego in check when things get tense, and runninggggggg when push comes to shove&#8230;).<br />
*</p>

<p>My injuries have been playing up and I&#8217;ve had the flu on and off for a month (arghh), so whilst I won both my grapples on points I wasn&#8217;t really on top of my game and I didn&#8217;t get any submissions :-( In both the grapples I was against smaller, more junior competitors so it wasn&#8217;t really fair on them, but none of the senior women entered &#8211; get off your as** and compete!!</p>

<p>My first grapple &#8211; versus a Moari woman from Boxing Works/Nova Uniao &#8211; she&#8217;s stocky and strong and being so short it was hard for me to get under her and take her down; but once we were down I just played my game &#8211; thanks Dan.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>My second grapple &#8211; versus Karla from my own team. She&#8217;s only been training for about 9 months but she did really well and I think she&#8217;ll be a good grappler in the future. She&#8217;s also a capoeirista, and it shows it her footwork.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>Some other grapples:</p>

<p>Genevieve from my team (green top and leggings) &#8211; she&#8217;s new but it&#8217;s really great that she&#8217;s entering competitions &#8211; they&#8217;re pretty daunting for a beginner. She was in the lighter weight division.</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>Just us (nervously) mucking around before going onto the mat. Like always, the waiting is the worst &#8211; butterflies, you feel ill, suddenly need to &#8220;visit the bathroom&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<!-- youtube?? -->

<p>Jason, a beginner from my team &#8211; he ripped his ear <em>again</em> and bled everywhere. Dude, wear headgear&#8230;</p>
