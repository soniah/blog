      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070801161511.htm&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedaily.com&#34;&gt;ScienceDaily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like humans, monkeys benefit enormously from being actively involved in learning instead of having information presented to them passively,&amp;rdquo; said Nate Kornell, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in psychology and lead author of the study, which appears in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science. &amp;ldquo;The advantage of active learning appears to be a fundamental property of memory in humans and nonhumans alike.&amp;rdquo; . &amp;ldquo;Many people,&amp;rdquo; Kornell noted, &amp;ldquo;have had the experience of listening to a computer instructor open a menu and go through a series of steps. Then you try to do it, and you don&amp;rsquo;t even know which menu or what the first step is. If you are passively following along, &lt;em&gt;you won&amp;rsquo;t remember it as well as if you&amp;rsquo;re forced to do it yourself. Active learning is much harder, but if you can do it successfully, you will remember it much better in the long run&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
