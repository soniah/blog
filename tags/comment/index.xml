      <title>Books are better?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that most of the time I&amp;rsquo;m happy with ebooks/webpages for learning a new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when it&amp;rsquo;s something difficult or something I really want to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok&#34;&gt;grok&lt;/a&gt;, I like to print things out or best of all buy a book (and then curl up on the couch and just &lt;em&gt;read and annotate&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://radar.oreilly.com&#34;&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Radar&lt;/a&gt; has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/digital-text-learning-ebooks-ereaders.html&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about a study that suggests university students learn better with paper books. (Let&amp;rsquo;s ignore the fact that O&amp;rsquo;Reilly are book publishers.).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another year, another Sydney Film Festival</title>
      <link>http://blog2.snowfrog.net/2009/06/17/another-year-another-sydney-film-festival/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year, another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sydneyfilmfestival.org/default.aspx&#34;&gt;Sydney Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two films I saw really stood out &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecovemovie.com/&#34;&gt;The Cove&lt;/a&gt; (about the continued Japanese dolphin slaughter) and Che &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892255/&#34;&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374569/&#34;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt; (covering the Cuban and Bolivian years of Ernesto &amp;lsquo;Che&amp;rsquo; Guevara). Also memorable was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bigriverman.com/&#34;&gt;Big River Man&lt;/a&gt;, about a middle aged  Slovenian man who swims the entire length of the Amazon river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like always (this is my approx 15th festival), I start the festival with feelings of both anticipation and trepidation &amp;ndash; anticipation that I&amp;rsquo;ll see some great films, and trepidation at the long nights and weekends in the dark, followed by getting up in the morning for work :-) But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like seeing a great movie with several thousand other cineastes in the splendour of the State Theatre to renew my love of good cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cove&lt;/strong&gt; works at multiple levels. Firstly we&amp;rsquo;re made to enjoy the almost James Bond nature of the film makers&amp;rsquo; mission, as the team try to infiltrate the area where the slaughter takes place in Taiji, Japan &amp;ndash; think spies and decoys, cameras disguised as rocks, and run-ins with guards. Then we&amp;rsquo;re made to feel revulsion at the killing of these animals that are so like us &amp;ndash; they love their freedom, get happy, sad, even commit suicide, and most of all are sentient (as in &amp;ldquo;having self awareness&amp;rdquo;). The scenes of the actual slaughter are gut-wrenching &amp;ndash; thousands of dolphins are herded into a 100m wide cove and killed by hand with harpoons. Dolphins in their death throws spin around in circles screaming, thrashing their tails, and even jumping onto land. The blood filled seawater turns opaque and divers feel their way along the seabed by hand, searching for carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then the film starts to ask some deeper questions. First of all, dolphin meat contains high levels of mercury due to pollution and is basically poisonousness and unsaleable. Eating meat with these levels of mercury leads to large numbers of horrendous birth defects &amp;ndash; which the Japanese unfortunately became aware of in the 70&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash; a whole generation of birth defects forcing the closure of  many polluting industries in Japan. So why keep up with the &amp;ldquo;harvest&amp;rdquo;, even if the meat has to be foisted onto the Japanese public via illegal meat substitution and Yakuza links? The answers seem to involve dirty international politics and ugly right wing Japanese nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, inorganic pollutants are concentrated as we move up the predator-prey cycle, and dolphins (like wolves, lions, humans) are at the top of the food chain. Dolphin meat contains so much mercury that it&amp;rsquo;s inedible &amp;ndash; what about us? How is that we can poison our environment so much that we&amp;rsquo;re poisoning ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ditch the Hummer, here comes the PUMA</title>
      <link>http://blog2.snowfrog.net/2009/04/08/ditch-the-hummer-here-comes-the-puma/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An article in today&amp;rsquo;s SMH &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/home/technology/meet-the-son-of-segway/2009/04/07/1238869976524.html&#34;&gt;Ditch the Hummer, here comes the PUMA&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; along with a jaunty photo of metrosexual darting through traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like it combines the disadvantages of a car (cost, need to fuel, too heavy to put on your shoulder) with the disadvantages of a bicycle (cold/hot, wet, you actually work up a sweat) without the fun of a motorcycle (speed &amp;ndash; yeh baby!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yawn. I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to my bicycle/car/dreams of hopping back on a motorbike. And keep using public transport whenever I can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CityFail does it again…</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;RailCorp is threatening a Sydney man with legal action after he created an iPhone application that allows people to monitor timetables for Sydney trains and ferries.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; from today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smh.com.au/news/digital-life/mobiles--handhelds/articles/cityrail-puts-brakes-on-iphone-app/2009/03/05/1235842537210.html&#34;&gt;SMH&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author (Alvin Singh) is currently working for News Digital, so RailCorp probably can&amp;rsquo;t contract him out for a few months or offer him a monetary payment for the app (which he has offered to RailCorp for free). How about accepting his offer of the code and giving him a yearly train pass.? Or letting him add in the bus, travel planner and service interruption stuff he&amp;rsquo;s said he wants to do, and giving him a yearly TravelPass?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join in the new game that&amp;rsquo;s sweeping the country. It&amp;rsquo;s called &amp;ldquo;Bureaucracy&amp;rdquo;. Everybody stands in a circle. The first person to do anything loses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*The Government&amp;rsquo;s plan to introduce mandatory internet censorship has effectively been scuttled,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;following an independent senator&amp;rsquo;s (Nick Xenophon) decision to join the Greens and Opposition in blocking any legislation required to get the scheme started..*&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monkeys Learn In The Same Way As Humans</title>
      <link>http://blog2.snowfrog.net/2007/08/02/monkeys-learn-in-the-same-way-as-humans/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070801161511.htm&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedaily.com&#34;&gt;ScienceDaily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like humans, monkeys benefit enormously from being actively involved in learning instead of having information presented to them passively,&amp;rdquo; said Nate Kornell, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in psychology and lead author of the study, which appears in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science. &amp;ldquo;The advantage of active learning appears to be a fundamental property of memory in humans and nonhumans alike.&amp;rdquo; . &amp;ldquo;Many people,&amp;rdquo; Kornell noted, &amp;ldquo;have had the experience of listening to a computer instructor open a menu and go through a series of steps. Then you try to do it, and you don&amp;rsquo;t even know which menu or what the first step is. If you are passively following along, &lt;em&gt;you won&amp;rsquo;t remember it as well as if you&amp;rsquo;re forced to do it yourself. Active learning is much harder, but if you can do it successfully, you will remember it much better in the long run&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
