I usually use *vimdiff* to find the differences between two files; here are some gui tools that do the same thing:
<!--more-->

  * meld -- though version 1.0.0 doesn&#8217;t allow line-by-line replacements (I&#8217;m told later versions do)
  * mgdiff -- doesn&#8217;t allow line-by-line replacements
  * tkdiff -- doesn&#8217;t allow line-by-line replacements
  * kompare -- allows line-by-line replacements, but the interface is a bit clunky (in that you can&#8217;t easily choose to take diffs from both files without reversing direction)

So kompare seems the best, though none seem as good as Windows tools I&#8217;ve used -- perhaps time to submit some changes to one of these projects&#8230;
