The Reverand Simon Rumble wrote a nice post on [Mobile broadband over Bluetooth with Ubuntu 8.10](http://www.rumble.net/blog/) using [Blueman](http://blueman.tuxfamily.org/). I've always wanted to get Bluetooth working on Ubuntu, but it was never at the top of my 'todo' list and I've always had other things to do (thank PHB). But Blueman makes it so easy - thanks Simon.

[This article](http://tanere.blogspot.com/2008/11/mobile-broadband-over-bluetooth-on.html) was also mentioned.
