iTunes&#8217; syncing of movies and podcasts is a big lame &#8211; there&#8217;s not enough fine grained control. For example, you can&#8217;t say &#8220;sync only this category of movies&#8221;, or &#8220;sync 30 minutes of podcast X, and 4 episodes of podcast Y, and only remove episodes of podcast Z after they&#8217;ve been listened to *twice*&#8220;. And at the moment I don&#8217;t have the time to migrate to Android and/or write my own podcast sync tools on Linux, so I&#8217;m stuck with iTunes/OSX. (I used to have some scripts for doing this for an ancient device, but device is dead and scripts are suffering from bit-rot).

One work around I&#8217;ve found is to categorise as much media as possible as either &#8220;Music&#8221; or &#8220;Music Videos&#8221;. You can then work with playlists and &#8220;smart&#8221; (sic) playlists to get a bit more control.
