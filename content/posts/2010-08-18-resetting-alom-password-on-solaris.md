Or, after RTFM'ing, an easier way: [SunDocs Recovering ALOM passwords][1]:

<!--more-->

  * connect to serial console, remove power cords, wait a few seconds
  * plugin, press escape repeatedly until it drops to the &#8220;ALOM <esc> menu&#8221;
  * e to erase ALOM NVRAM (will return everything to defaults)
  * r to return to boot process
  * machine will then reboot, drop into ALOM prompt as admin with no password

Some notes on how to reset the ALOM password onÂ Solaris (done on a VT240).

**ALOM** has sc> prompt. Get to OBP using &#8220;console -f&#8221;

**OBP** (Open Boot Prompt) has ok prompt. Get to ALOM using &#8220;#.&#8221;

**Power switch** has 4 positions: Normal (|), Locked (padlock), Diagnostics (wave), Forced Off (circle-bar). Ensure powerswitch is in Normal position.

Replace disks with disks from another system that has a known password, then boot. (Also, try a boot cd). At root prompt:

<pre><tt># cd /usr/platform/`uname -i`/sbin
# ./scadm userpassword admin         (set to default ie sun123)
# #.                                 (return to ALOM)
sc&gt;resetsc
sc&gt;poweroff -f</tt></pre>

Remove power cords, return old hard disks, turn back on. These last steps aren't necessary, but it's good to check that the ALOM password has indeed been reset.
