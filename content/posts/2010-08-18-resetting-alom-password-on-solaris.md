Or, after RTFM'ing, an easier way: [SunDocs Recovering ALOM passwords](http://docs.sun.com/source/819-6672-10/trouble_appx.html#53290):



	
  * connect to serial console, remove power cords, wait a few seconds

	
  * plugin, press escape repeatedly until it drops to the "ALOM <esc> menu"

	
  * e to erase ALOM NVRAM (will return everything to defaults)

	
  * r to return to boot process

	
  * machine will then reboot, drop into ALOM prompt as admin with no password

Some notes on how to reset the ALOM password onÂ Solaris (done on a VT240).

**ALOM** has sc> prompt. Get to OBP using "console -f"

**OBP** (Open Boot Prompt) has ok prompt. Get to ALOM using "#."

**Power switch** has 4 positions: Normal (|), Locked (padlock), Diagnostics (wave), Forced Off (circle-bar). Ensure powerswitch is in Normal position.

Replace disks with disks from another system that has a known password, then boot. (Also, try a boot cd). At root prompt:

    
    <tt># cd /usr/platform/`uname -i`/sbin
    # ./scadm userpassword admin         (set to default ie sun123)
    # #.                                 (return to ALOM)
    sc>resetsc
    sc>poweroff -f</tt>


Remove power cords, return old hard disks, turn back on. These last steps aren't necessary, but it's good to check that the ALOM password has indeed been reset.
