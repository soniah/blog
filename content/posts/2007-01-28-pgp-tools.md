A useful collection of scripts for helping with pgp, including caff  - _a script that helps you in keysigning_ - [http://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/](http://pgp-tools.alioth.debian.org/). In Debian, these tools are included in the [signing-party](http://packages.debian.org/signing-party) package. There's also a writeup about how to use them effectively (addressed to the participants of LCA2006) [here](http://www.wlug.org.nz/KeySigningScripts).

Download, install and configure the latest version (if distro's version is old):<!-- more -->

    
    
     sudo aptitude install libtext-template-perl gnupg-agent
     sudo dpkg -i signing-party_0.4.9-1_all.deb
     cp /usr/share/doc/signing-party/caff/caffrc.sample .caffrc
     vi .caffrc (change name, key, etc, add $CONFIG{'gpg-sign-args'} = "save";)


Configure caff's gpg.conf:

    
    
     $ cat .caff/gnupghome/gpg.conf
     use-agent
     no-greeting
     encrypt-to 0xA8B77238


Check keyrings & produce a list of keys to sign:

    
    
     cat *md5
     md5sum keylist.txt
     md5dum keyring.gpg
     grep ' pub ' keylist.txt | cut --characters=31-39 > foo


Sign and send them:

    
    
     eval `gpg-agent --daemon`
     caff --no-export-old --mail --no-download --key-file keyring.gpg `cat foo`

Most keys can be imported in mutt by typing _ctrl-k_. For those that can't, save the message as a file then do:

    
    
     gpg file | gpg --import
