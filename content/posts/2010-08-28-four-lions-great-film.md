Great film -- "Four Lions".

<!--more-->

It's about four would-be Jihadi's from England trying to reach heaven by blowing up something big -- eg the local chemist. The only problem is that these guys are *stupid, out-and-out muppets *-- think suicide crow-bombs, guys eating (and choking on) their SIM card to "evade detection", secret messages between animated puffins, idiots with Cornish accents arguing over who is "more Jihadi", .

Seriously funny.
