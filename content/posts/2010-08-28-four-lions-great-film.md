Great film -- &#8220;Four Lions&#8221;.

<!--more-->

It's about four would-be Jihadi's from England trying to reach heaven by blowing up something big -- eg the local chemist. The only problem is that these guys are *stupid, out-and-out muppets *-- think suicide crow-bombs, guys eating (and choking on) their SIM card to &#8220;evade detection&#8221;, secret messages between animated puffins, idiots with Cornish accents arguing over who is &#8220;more Jihadi&#8221;, &#8230;

Seriously funny.
