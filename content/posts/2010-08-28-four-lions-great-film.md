Great film &#8211; &#8220;Four Lions&#8221;.

<!--more-->

It&#8217;s about four would-be Jihadi&#8217;s from England trying to reach heaven by blowing up something big &#8211; eg the local chemist. The only problem is that these guys are *stupid, out-and-out muppets *&#8211; think suicide crow-bombs, guys eating (and choking on) their SIM card to &#8220;evade detection&#8221;, secret messages between animated puffins, idiots with Cornish accents arguing over who is &#8220;more Jihadi&#8221;, &#8230;

Seriously funny.
