A nice tool written by Jeremy Visser &#8211; [Python-iView][1].

<!--more-->

As Jeremy [says][2] on his blog: &#8220;Python-iView is an alternative frontend to ABC iView, which &#8230; is an awesome ABC TV programme catchup service that lets you watch most ABC programs from the last month in your browser&#8230; However, the iView website has some major problems&#8230; To address this, I wrote the open source (GPLv3) application Python-iView, which &#8230; allows you to download episodes to your hard drive in their original FLV format.&#8221;

Thanks Jeremy!
