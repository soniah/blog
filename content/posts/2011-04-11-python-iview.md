A nice tool written by Jeremy Visser -- [Python-iView][1].

<!--more-->

As Jeremy [says][2] on his blog: "Python-iView is an alternative frontend to ABC iView, which . is an awesome ABC TV programme catchup service that lets you watch most ABC programs from the last month in your browser. However, the iView website has some major problems. To address this, I wrote the open source (GPLv3) application Python-iView, which . allows you to download episodes to your hard drive in their original FLV format."

Thanks Jeremy!
