I flew up to [Brisbane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane) over the weekend for another [BJJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjj) martial arts competition (won first fight but DQ'd for accidental illegal move, won second fight). Going throught the airport I was flicking through stuff in the bookshop and came across [The 4-Hour Body](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X). The back cover said "Do Not Read This Book Unless You Want Immediate Results", "Lose 2% of body fat in two weeks", etc etc, and I thought "here we go another hype-filled stupid dieting book. What's so hard - eat less, exercise more...".

Then I noticed the author was Timothy Ferris, who also wrote [The 4-Hour Work Week](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Expanded-Updated-Cutting-Edge/dp/0307465357/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1299460078&sr=1-1), which I've read and was impressed with. Then I flicked through to the section on "Reversing 'Permanent' Injuries". He starts immediately with posture, [Vibram five finger shoes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FiveFingers) and the [Egoscue Method](http://www.amazon.com/Pain-Free-Revolutionary-Stopping-Chronic/dp/0553379887/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1299460163&sr=1-2) (all  tools I use) and I thought "this guy knows what he's talking about".  Bought the book and started devouring it.

The book should be called "Body Hacking" as it covers solutions to the physical problems that ail most of us at sometime - food, weight, sleep, back pain, endurance, stress, etc. It's like an body encylopedia and he suggests you just read the first couple of chapters then pick and choose the area you want to focus on. But of course I ignored that and I'm doing a speed read of the whole book to pick up the juicy stuff, then I'll go back for a "deep dive".

A good example - the chapter on insomnia. I train BJJ most week nights so I often have difficulty sleeping as I'm so amped up with adrenyline. Combined with my job in [Information Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) which regularly involves staying up overnight on the weekends for system changes and what you get is bad insomnia ie I often can't sleep until 2-3am, struggle to get out of bed and feel like crap until midday. His suggestions which I'm going to implement:



	
  * an [ice bath](http://www.google.com.au/images?q=ice+bath&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&sa=X&ei=ijB0TdCKKoWctweQpIWJDw&ved=0CG4QsAQ&biw=1440&bih=743) one hour prior to bed (I already use ice baths for muscle regeneration)

	
  * [SAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder) light cues - the [Philips goLITE](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I45XL8?ie=UTF8&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001I45XL8)

	
  * use an ultrasonic [humidifier](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JL4LZ4?ie=UTF8&tag=offsitoftimfe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001JL4LZ4) (also helps with sinusses and allergies)

	
  * a large fat and protein dominated meal three hours before bedtime


Eating a "large fat and protein dominated meal before bedtime" might raise your eyebrows. In other sections he explains why to avoid too many carbs and worry less about fats, how relating calories-in (food) to calories-out (exercise) is not the whole story, and why you should be thinking about the right type of foods rather than calories.

I've already come across many of these ideas floating around the internet, but he brings them all together. All-in-all a great book!
