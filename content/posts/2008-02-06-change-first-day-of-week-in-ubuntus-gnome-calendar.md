Under the Australian locale, the first day of the week appears as Sunday rather than Monday, which is incorrect. To change it:

<!--more-->

  * check which locale is running, using the **locale** command (ie **en_AU**)
  * **sudo vi /usr/share/i18n/locales/en_AU** and change **first_weekday** and **first_workday** to 2
  * regenerate the locale using **sudo locale-gen**
  * get the calendar to reload using **killall gnome-panel**

In another post, I also show [how to automate this][1], so it doesn't get reset by Ubuntu's automatic updates.
