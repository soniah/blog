I've written this post for the non-technical people I do "tech support" for.

Do you use the _same_ password on different websites? Or, the same password with _slight variations_ (for example **secret-abc** on website **abc.com** and **secret-xyz** on website **xyz.com**). Or, do you make your password "secure" (it's not) by changing one of the letters for a number or symbol (eg **secret** becomes **s3cret**, **password** becomes **p@ssword**).

Well, you should change all your passwords _right now_! [None of these methods are secure](http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=1727&p=3).

Why not? Hackers (crackers) are regularly breaking into public websites (recently [LinkedIn](http://www.mediabistro.com/mediajobsdaily/linkedin-posts-update-to-last-weeks-6-5-million-hacked-passwords_b11275), [Last.Fm](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/another-hack-last-fm-warns-users-to-change-their-passwords/), [Sony](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/06/sony-hacked-yet-again-plaintext-passwords-posted/), [Facebook](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2083118/Facebook-hacked-Ramnit-worm-stolen-passwords-45-000-users.html)) and stealing the encrypted password database. Unfortunately, due to computers getting faster and programming errors, hackers are easily "reverse engineer" these passwords, especially if you've used _a word that appears in a dictionary_ (**any** dictionary - English, a foreign language, a slang word).

Well why is that a problem? Let's imagine you are **Fred Smith** and you have a username/password **fredsmith** and **s3cret** on a website. A hacker breaks into this website, steals all the encrypted passwords. After about 6 hours they've cracked your password as it's based on a dictionary word. The hacker will then [automatically try this username/password (and variations) against lots of other websites](http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=1727&p=3). Your username/password on Facebook is **fsmith** and **s3cret** -  account stolen. Your username/password on Hotmail is **fredsmith** and **secret!** - account stolen. Etc, etc.

**So what do I do?**

Two steps:



	
  1. use good passwords generated by a password generator or tool

	
  2. store your passwords in some sort of "password vault", and protect that vault really well


**Using a password generator**

Generating _good_ passwords is **hard** - you need to make sure they [contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols, and are long](https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm). But you want them to be easy to remember. You can take the first letters of a song or saying and convert it into a password (for example **Sydney rains all the time I'm tired of getting wet** becomes **SrattItogw**). But that's hard work too - all those different websites to generate passwords for!

So don't - use a password generation tool instead - for example [Strong Password Generator](http://strongpasswordgenerator.com/) [1]. Or [Google for Password Generator](https://www.google.com.au/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=19&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=password+generator). Don't use sites [like this this one that ask for the site name too](http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.html) - duh!

**Using a Password Vault**

Remembering all these passwords like **iI&[-7;F&3@}$4R** and **T"7c3+-,t,3}}P@** is **hard** too!

So don't - use a [password vault](https://www.google.com.au/search?aq=f&sugexp=chrome,mod=19&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=password+vault) like [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/) (and install it as a plugin in your browser: [Chrome ($free)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd), [Firefox ($free)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager/), [Internet Explorer ($costs)](http://helpdesk.lastpass.com/upgrading-to-premium/ie-anywhere/)). Make sure your password vault is backed up and use a really strong password for  your vault. And even better, install [Google Authenticator](http://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/) on your phone ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en), [iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)) and use it to protect your LastPass vault.

**PS**



	
  * [1] ideally you would install a password generator tool on your laptop, but a website is better than nothing

	
  * LastPass has a tool called “Security Check” – it will check all your passwords, look for duplicates, weak passwords, etc. Great!
