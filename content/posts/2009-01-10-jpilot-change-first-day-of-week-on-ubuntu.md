I still use JPilot for syncing with my Palm Treo &#8211; an old app but I like it, especially because of JPilot-Keyring.

But there&#8217;s no way of changing the first day of the week in JPilot, and consequently the first day of the week appears as Sunday rather than Monday &#8211; yikes, [Christianity][1]! The solution is to [change the first day of the week in Gnome][2], and JPilot then picks it up.
