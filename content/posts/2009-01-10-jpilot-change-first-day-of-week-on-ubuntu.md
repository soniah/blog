I still use JPilot for syncing with my Palm Treo - an old app but I like it, especially because of JPilot-Keyring.

But there's no way of changing the first day of the week in JPilot, and consequently the first day of the week appears as Sunday rather than Monday - yikes, [Christianity](http://www.cafepress.com/antireligion/639003)! The solution is to [change the first day of the week in Gnome](http://blog.snowfrog.net/2008/02/06/change-first-day-of-week-in-ubuntus-gnome-calendar/), and JPilot then picks it up.
