A nice git option I stumbled upon today - [amend](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#fixing-a-mistake-by-rewriting-history).

Typical scenario - you've done a local check-in, then notice there's a typo in your code comments. Fix up the typo, then use **- - amend** to re-check-in, without having to do a reset/revert. For example:

    
    git add foo.file
    git ci -m "added the frob feature to the whiz-bang"
    ...
    notice and fix typo in foo.file
    ...
    git add foo.file
    git ci --amend


When you do the amend check-in, your editor will pop up, allowing you to re-edit the commit message if desired.

Obviously, if you've done a commit to a remote/public repository, amend has issues, similar to reset.

Also, I have entries like this in my .gitconfig, hence "git ci" rather than "git commit".

    
    [alias]
            ci = commit
            co = checkout
            st = status
            br = branch
