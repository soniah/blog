"RailCorp is threatening a Sydney man with legal action after he created an iPhone application that allows people to monitor timetables for Sydney trains and ferries." - from today's [SMH](http://www.smh.com.au/news/digital-life/mobiles--handhelds/articles/cityrail-puts-brakes-on-iphone-app/2009/03/05/1235842537210.html).

The author (Alvin Singh) is currently working for News Digital, so RailCorp probably can't contract him out for a few months or offer him a monetary payment for the app (which he has offered to RailCorp for free). How about accepting his offer of the code and giving him a yearly train pass...? Or letting him add in the bus, travel planner and service interruption stuff he's said he wants to do, and giving him a yearly TravelPass?
