I've been using [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html) for years, and I always wished it had a "broadcast" functionality like [MultiXterm](http://expect.sourceforge.net/example/multixterm.man.html).

Anyway, this morning I came across [Terminator](http://www.tenshu.net/p/terminator.html) - it splits screens, has broadcasts, etc (probably old news for some people...).

By the way, you can [split screens in GNU Screen](http://blog.snowfrog.net/2012/03/19/gnu-screen-split-screens/).
