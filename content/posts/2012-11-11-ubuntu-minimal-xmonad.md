I'm tired of Ubuntu's latest desktop <del>mess</del> offering (Unity). I've been trying lots of DE's (Desktop Environments) and WM's (Window Managers), and I've finally settled on one I luuuuurv - [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/).

On my next laptop build I was thinking of moving to Debian Netinst, but I like the Ubuntu ppa system. So my next laptop install will be [Ubuntu Minimal](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD) + [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/); will also me a good motivation for [learning Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

I'd looked Cinnamon and Gnome3 (more of the same), KDE (bleh - still looks like Windows 98), Fluxbox and XFCE. Then this [great article about Joey Hess](http://joey.hess.usesthis.com/) (original writer of the db_* debhelper tools) pointed me to Xmonad.
