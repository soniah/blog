Opinions around the latest Ubuntu (11.04) range from "interesting" (as in the curse "may you live in interesting times") to "it sucks".

Anyway, there no longer appears to be a link to the previous version (10.10 Maverick) on the main Ubuntu page -- marketing droids seem to have finally taken over Ubuntu. It can be downloaded from [here][1].

No rocket science -- I just don't want to have to look for the location in future.
