Opinions around the latest Ubuntu (11.04) range from &#8220;interesting&#8221; (as in the curse &#8220;may you live in interesting times&#8221;) to &#8220;it sucks&#8221;.

Anyway, there no longer appears to be a link to the previous version (10.10 Maverick) on the main Ubuntu page -- marketing droids seem to have finally taken over Ubuntu. It can be downloaded from [here][1].

No rocket science -- I just don&#8217;t want to have to look for the location in future.
