KDan (via [Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/11/1746250&from=rss)) has a great post on [how to recognise a good programmer](http://www.inter-sections.net/2007/11/13/how-to-recognise-a-good-programmer/); I think many of his points also apply to system administrators.

Some of the key points:



	
  * passionate about technology, will talk your ear off on a technical subject if encouraged; technology isn't a day job but a lifestyle

	
  * learns new technologies on their own, and doesn't say "send me on a course to learn that"

	
  * very uncomfortable about the idea of working with a technology they don't believe to be “right”

	
  * has some hidden “icebergs”, large personal projects under the CV radar


All-in-all a really great article - I suggest you read it.
