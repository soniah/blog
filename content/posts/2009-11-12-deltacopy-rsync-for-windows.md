A nice little tool I came across - [DeltaCopy](http://www.aboutmyip.com/AboutMyXApp/DeltaCopy.jsp) - for when you have to work with Windows desktops and want to rsync (and don't want to install [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)). I haven't had time to play with it yet, but apparently the DeltaCopy client will connect to an rsync server.

Out of interest, there's also a [SourceForge package](http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/) for installing a minimal ssh server on Windows, rather than the full Cygwin.
