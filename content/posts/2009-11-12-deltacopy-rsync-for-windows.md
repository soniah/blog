A nice little tool I came across &#8211; [DeltaCopy][1] &#8211;

<!--more-->

for when you have to work with Windows desktops and want to rsync (and don&#8217;t want to install [Cygwin][2]). I haven&#8217;t had time to play with it yet, but apparently the DeltaCopy client will connect to an rsync server.

Out of interest, there&#8217;s also a [SourceForge package][3] for installing a minimal ssh server on Windows, rather than the full Cygwin.
