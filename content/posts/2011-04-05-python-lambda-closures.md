A very interesting [post][2] from Andr√© Pang about some issues he came across with lamdas and closures in Python. Well, interesting to me because I'm playing with Lisp and Python at the moment&#8230;

Some links from his blog, in case the original post ever disappears:

  * the [question and responses][3] on stackoverflow
  * an [example][4] of the perils of Python's scoping rules with for/while/if
  * Wikipedia -- [differences in semantics of closures][5]

A nice snippet of code to remind me of the issues:

<pre>def callback(msg):
    print msg
funcList=[]
for m in ('do', 're', 'mi'):
    # funcList.append(lambda: callback(m))
    funcList.append(lambda m=m: callback(m))
for f in funcList:
    f()</pre>
