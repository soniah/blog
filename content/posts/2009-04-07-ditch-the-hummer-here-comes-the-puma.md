An article in today's SMH - [Ditch the Hummer, here comes the PUMA](http://www.smh.com.au/news/home/technology/meet-the-son-of-segway/2009/04/07/1238869976524.html) - along with a jaunty photo of metrosexual darting through traffic. Looks like it combines the disadvantages of a car (cost, need to fuel, too heavy to put on your shoulder) with the disadvantages of a bicycle (cold/hot, wet, you actually work up a sweat) without the fun of a motorcycle (speed - yeh baby!).

Yawn. I'll stick to my bicycle/car/dreams of hopping back on a motorbike. And keep using public transport whenever I can.
