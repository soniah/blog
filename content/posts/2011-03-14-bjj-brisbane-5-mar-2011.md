Results from the BJJ competition, Sat 5/Mar in Brisbane. I&#8217;ve left this too long, so a quick post.

Also: Laura&#8217;s post &#8211; [2011 Queensland State Championships results][1]

My first grapple (no-gi) I submitted my opponent (Cara Johnson) by footlock in about 15 seconds, got declared the winner, then got disqualified a few minutes later by the head referee! (making Cara the winner) Reason being I rolled inwards on the footlock rather than outwards, thus putting unnecessary pressure on her knee (as you can see below. And my Left Foot position is a bit dodgy too). A rule that hadn&#8217;t lodged in my brain &#8211; I&#8217;ll remember it now :-)

My second grapple (gi) was again with Cara. Neither of us dominated the grapple, but I narrowly won on points.

Thanks Cara for being a strong but friendly opponent &#8211; I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll meet on the mats again!

My other team mates (Arron and Les) were both &#8220;on fire&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t get to see many of their grapples as I was working on the tables, but I did manage to record this one of Les:

Also, I got a video of Cara Johnson versus Laura Ng in the Opens. For some reason (a blond moment?) I didn&#8217;t enter into the Opens &#8211; duh!
