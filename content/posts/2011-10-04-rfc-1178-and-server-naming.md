Whenever I come across servers with names like **chpvuat01**, I'm reminded of [RFC 1178](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1178) "Choosing a name for your computer". Especially when **ch** stands for **crack house**, **pv** stands for **paid verbiage**, but **uat** _doesn't_ stand for **user acceptance testing**: the box used to be in UAT, was moved to SIT (System Integration Testing), but _kept it's old name because renaming it would be too hard..._

From the RFC:
_Using a word that has strong semantic implications in the current context will cause confusion.__ Don't choose a name after a project unique to that machine._

Name machines after [D&D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) characters, [LOTR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) characters, planets, flowers, animals, whatever, but not their function!**
**

(Hostname has been obfuscated to protect the not-so-innocent, though the project may as well be called _crack house_).
