Whenever I come across servers with names like **chpvuat01**, I'm reminded of [RFC 1178][1] "Choosing a name for your computer". Especially when **ch** stands for **crack house**, **pv** stands for **paid verbiage**, but **uat** *doesn't* stand for **user acceptance testing**: the box used to be in UAT, was moved to SIT (System Integration Testing), but *kept it's old name because renaming it would be too hard.*

<!--more-->

From the RFC:  
*Using a word that has strong semantic implications in the current context will cause confusion.** Don't choose a name after a project unique to that machine.*

Name machines after [D&D][2] characters, [LOTR][3] characters, planets, flowers, animals, whatever, but not their function!**  
**

(Hostname has been obfuscated to protect the not-so-innocent, though the project may as well be called *crack house*).
