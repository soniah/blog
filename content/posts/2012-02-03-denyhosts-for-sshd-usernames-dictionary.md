I've just setup the venerable [denyhosts][1] on one of my servers, to stop the usual script-kiddies from *filling up my logs* (I'm not particularly worried about them getting in.).

Anyway, here is [restricted-usernames.gz][2], a list of denied usernames from the log -- handy to add to your denyhosts [restricted-usernames file][3]. There's probably a better dictionary of usernames out there -- I'll attach it if I <del>find it</del> stumble upon it.
