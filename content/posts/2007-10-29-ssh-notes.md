**<span style="color:#00008b;">$ ssh -fN -L localport:remoteserver:remoteport hopserver</span>**

<span style="color:#00008b;">Optionally combined with agent forwarding and user/hostname mapping in .ssh/config; optionally combined with this in .ssh/config if drilling through a squid proxy:<br /> </span>

<pre>Host remoteserver
    Hostname remoteserver
    ProxyCommand connect-proxy -S dmzproxy.foo.com:1080 %h %p</pre>

**To setup an ssh tunnel (4 machines):**  
`<br />
hosta$ ssh -fN`` -o GateWayPorts=yes`` -L P:S:W`` user@B`  
` hostc$ some-app A:P<br />
`  
-f &#8211; go into background after asking for a password  
-N &#8211; don&#8217;t execute a remote command  
-g &#8211; gateway (or **-o GateWayPorts=yes**) &#8211; may be required if doing double ssh (ie one tunnel feeding in to a second tunnel); **will** be required to allow connections to forwarded port from external hosts (ie not localhost)

Data between C and A *won&#8217;t* be encrypted; data between A and B *will* be encrypted; data between B and S *won&#8217;t* be encrypted.

**To setup an ssh tunnel (3 machines):**

If Host C and Host A are the *same machine*:  
`<br />
hosta$ ssh -fN -L P:S:W user@B`  
` hosta$ some-app A:P`

If Host B and Host S are the *same machine*:

` hosta$ ssh -fN -o GateWayPorts=yes -L P:B:W user@B`  
` hostc$ some-app A:P`

**To setup an ssh tunnel (2 machines):**

Another common case is where both C and A, and B and S, are the same machines &#8211; call them *local* and *remote*. There are 2 possible commands:  
`<br />
local$ ssh -fN -L P:localhost:W remote<br />
local$ ssh -fN -L P:remote:W remote<br />
`  
Both will usually work, but to the destination server (1) appears to come from 127.0.0.1 and (2) appears to come from remote&#8217;s ip. (1) would give &#8220;connection refused&#8221; errors if connections aren&#8217;t allowed from localhost (unusual), (2) would give &#8220;connection refused&#8221; errors if connections aren&#8217;t allowed from anything but localhost (eg typically mysql).

To connect, do **ssh -p P foo@localhost**. Be aware of account name issues ie localhost and remote are different hosts, so a tunnel may succeed but then the ssh command fail due to account name mismatches &#8211; hence the **foo@**localhost.

**Some tricks from [this article][3]:**

`$ ssh user@intermediate-server -D 8080 # setup a pseudo socks server; point socks-able apps at localhost:8080`
