**<span style="color:#00008b;">$ ssh -fN -L localport:remoteserver:remoteport hopserver</span>**

<span style="color:#00008b;">Optionally combined with agent forwarding and user/hostname mapping in .ssh/config; optionally combined with this in .ssh/config if drilling through a squid proxy:<br /> </span>

<pre>Host remoteserver
    Hostname remoteserver
    ProxyCommand connect-proxy -S dmzproxy.foo.com:1080 %h %p</pre>

**To setup an ssh tunnel (4 machines):**  
`<br />
hosta$ ssh -fN`` -o GateWayPorts=yes`` -L P:S:W`` user@B`  
` hostc$ some-app A:P<br />
`  
-f -- go into background after asking for a password  
-N -- don't execute a remote command  
-g -- gateway (or **-o GateWayPorts=yes**) -- may be required if doing double ssh (ie one tunnel feeding in to a second tunnel); **will** be required to allow connections to forwarded port from external hosts (ie not localhost)

Data between C and A *won't* be encrypted; data between A and B *will* be encrypted; data between B and S *won't* be encrypted.

**To setup an ssh tunnel (3 machines):**

If Host C and Host A are the *same machine*:  
`<br />
hosta$ ssh -fN -L P:S:W user@B`  
` hosta$ some-app A:P`

If Host B and Host S are the *same machine*:

` hosta$ ssh -fN -o GateWayPorts=yes -L P:B:W user@B`  
` hostc$ some-app A:P`

**To setup an ssh tunnel (2 machines):**

Another common case is where both C and A, and B and S, are the same machines -- call them *local* and *remote*. There are 2 possible commands:  
`<br />
local$ ssh -fN -L P:localhost:W remote<br />
local$ ssh -fN -L P:remote:W remote<br />
`  
Both will usually work, but to the destination server (1) appears to come from 127.0.0.1 and (2) appears to come from remote's ip. (1) would give "connection refused" errors if connections aren't allowed from localhost (unusual), (2) would give "connection refused" errors if connections aren't allowed from anything but localhost (eg typically mysql).

To connect, do **ssh -p P foo@localhost**. Be aware of account name issues ie localhost and remote are different hosts, so a tunnel may succeed but then the ssh command fail due to account name mismatches -- hence the **foo@**localhost.

**Some tricks from [this article][3]:**

`$ ssh user@intermediate-server -D 8080 # setup a pseudo socks server; point socks-able apps at localhost:8080`
