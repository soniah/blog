I&#8217;m sporting a nice black eye at the moment from [BJJ][1].

<!--more-->

It&#8217;s not actually one black eye but three, all received in the last week. The first one was a jab in the eye at the Victorian (Australia) state competition last week (which I won). Then a few days later Eric (the feisty Judo black belt I like to tangle with) accidentally elbowed me &#8211; instant shiner. Then the following day Eleni accidentally scratched the same eye &#8211; ouch! I haven&#8217;t copped a black eye for years, so I must be doing something different. Hmmm&#8230;.

It&#8217;s the start of Autumn here, so we&#8217;re back to more gi than no-gi training. A battle getting back into a gi, with the heat and humidity. Yesterday it was 29C (80F) with 80% humidity &#8211; erk. Our instructor (Daniel Sainty) is usually fairly strict about drink breaks, but last night he was positively encouraging us to drink water &#8211; four breaks in all during the two hours of training. But it&#8217;s hard living in paradise ([Sydney][2], Australia) &#8211; clear skies, beaches, surf, good food from over 100 cultures, handsome Brazilian tourists and immigrants everywhere :-)
