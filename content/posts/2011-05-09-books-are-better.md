I've noticed that most of the time I'm happy with ebooks/webpages for learning a new technology. But when it's something difficult or something I really want to [grok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok), I like to print things out or best of all buy a book (and then curl up on the couch and just _read and annotate_).

Maybe I'm not the only one - [O'Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com) has an [article](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/digital-text-learning-ebooks-ereaders.html) about a study that suggests university students learn better with paper books. (Let's ignore the fact that O'Reilly are book publishers...).
