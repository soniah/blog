I&#8217;ve noticed that most of the time I&#8217;m happy with ebooks/webpages for learning a new technology. But when it&#8217;s something difficult or something I really want to [grok][1], I like to print things out or best of all buy a book (and then curl up on the couch and just *read and annotate*).

Maybe I&#8217;m not the only one &#8211; [O&#8217;Reilly Radar][2] has an [article][3] about a study that suggests university students learn better with paper books. (Let&#8217;s ignore the fact that O&#8217;Reilly are book publishers&#8230;).
