&#8220;RailCorp is threatening a Sydney man with legal action after he created an iPhone application that allows people to monitor timetables for Sydney trains and ferries.&#8221; &#8211; from today&#8217;s [SMH][1].

The author (Alvin Singh) is currently working for News Digital, so RailCorp probably can&#8217;t contract him out for a few months or offer him a monetary payment for the app (which he has offered to RailCorp for free). How about accepting his offer of the code and giving him a yearly train pass&#8230;? Or letting him add in the bus, travel planner and service interruption stuff he&#8217;s said he wants to do, and giving him a yearly TravelPass?

*Join in the new game that&#8217;s sweeping the country. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Bureaucracy&#8221;. Everybody stands in a circle. The first person to do anything loses.*
