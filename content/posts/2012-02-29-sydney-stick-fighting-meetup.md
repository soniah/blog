I've setup a new Meetup.com group called [Sydney Stick Fighting](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-Stick-Fighting/). It's early days yet, I'm still gathering email addresses and getting people to join up.

Here's the description of the group:


_A group for practitioners of the Filipino art of [Balintawak Arnis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balintawak_Eskrima) (stick fighting). Arnis (also known as Esgrima or Kali) is a very practical martial art that involves sticks, striking, grappling or improvised weapons. It is becoming more popular (for example the [Jason Bourne](http://howtofightlikejasonbourne.com/) movies or [other movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskrima_in_popular_culture)) and is usually practiced outdoors rather than in a gym. Beginners are always welcome, or you can just come along and watch the action!_
