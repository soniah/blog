I&#8217;ve setup a new Meetup.com group called [Sydney Stick Fighting][1]. It&#8217;s early days yet, I&#8217;m still gathering email addresses and getting people to join up.

Here&#8217;s the description of the group:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>A group for practitioners of the Filipino art of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balintawak_Eskrima">Balintawak Arnis</a> (stick fighting). Arnis (also known as Esgrima or Kali) is a very practical martial art that involves sticks, striking, grappling or improvised weapons. It is becoming more popular (for example the <a href="http://howtofightlikejasonbourne.com/">Jason Bourne</a> movies or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskrima_in_popular_culture">other movies</a>) and is usually practiced outdoors rather than in a gym. Beginners are always welcome, or you can just come along and watch the action!</em>
