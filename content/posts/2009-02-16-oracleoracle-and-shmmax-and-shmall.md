A [good article][1] on Oracle and shmmax and shmall. In a nutshell:

<!--more-->

  * **shmall** it is not the maximum amount of memory which can be allocated, it is the maximum size of any shared memory chunk -- how big a bite you want per bite from free memory.
  * **shmmax** -- its value determines the maximum amount of memory that ALL shared memory can take. the actual setting is derivedâ€¦ the maximum amount of memory = shmall * pagesize where pagesize = getconf PAGE_SIZE and shmall = cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
