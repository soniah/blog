A [good article](http://www.pythian.com/blogs/245/the-mysterious-world-of-shmmax-and-shmall) on Oracle and shmmax and shmall. In a nutshell:






  * **shmall** it is not the maximum amount of memory which can be allocated, it is the maximum size of any shared memory chunk - how big a bite you want per bite from free memory.


  * **shmmax** - its value determines the maximum amount of memory that ALL shared memory can take. the actual setting is derivedâ€¦ the maximum amount of memory = shmall * pagesize where pagesize = getconf PAGE_SIZE and shmall = cat /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
