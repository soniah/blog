I'm busy learning [LISP][1]/[Scheme][2] at the moment (in order to later move on to [Clojure][3]). 

<!--more-->

And, improving my programming learning LISP is :-)

I'm following along with the [MIT][4] [SICP][5] videos, but got tired of manually downloading each video. So I wrote a quick little script to download all the videos -- [get_sicp][6]. Next, a script for the [UC Berkeley SICP videos][7] (getting through the flash player should be a learning experience).

I've also been getting good mileage out of JRuby. I was [complaining][8] a few weeks ago about not being able to run Ruby on production servers (and therefore having to learn Python). Well JRuby is the perfect solution -- installing/building Ruby on production servers is often verboten, but most production servers already have a JVM so installing JRuby in ${HOME} is a non-brainer and doesn't litter /usr. Good: Ruby -- fun, Python -- <snore>.
