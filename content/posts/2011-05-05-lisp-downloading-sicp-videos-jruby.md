I&#8217;m busy learning [LISP][1]/[Scheme][2] at the moment (in order to later move on to [Clojure][3]). And, improving my programming learning LISP is :-)

I&#8217;m following along with the [MIT][4] [SICP][5] videos, but got tired of manually downloading each video. So I wrote a quick little script to download all the videos &#8211; [get_sicp][6]. Next, a script for the [UC Berkeley SICP videos][7] (getting through the flash player should be a learning experience).

I&#8217;ve also been getting good mileage out of JRuby. I was [complaining][8] a few weeks ago about not being able to run Ruby on production servers (and therefore having to learn Python). Well JRuby is the perfect solution &#8211; installing/building Ruby on production servers is often verboten, but most production servers already have a JVM so installing JRuby in ${HOME} is a non-brainer and doesn&#8217;t litter /usr. Good: Ruby &#8211; fun, Python &#8211; <snore>.
