I've used [putty.exe](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) for doing ssh client work on Windows machines for years. But I always thought that any Windows ssh servers were commercial, so when I've really had to have Windows ssh access I've setup [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/).

But here's a free (as in speech and beer) .exe that installs just an ssh server - [sshwindows](http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/). Probably been around forever, but since I use Windows so little nowadays I've haven't heard about it until now.

Of course the nice thing about this coming from the [OpenSSH project](http://www.openssh.com/) is that MiÂ¢ro$oft haven't been able to get their [grubby little fingers into the protocol and pervert it](http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/) (an old conspiracy theory, I know).
