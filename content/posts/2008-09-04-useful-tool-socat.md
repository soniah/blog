A useful tool I've come across (thanks JB) -- **socat**. As the [homepage][1] says, sort of netcat++.

<!--more-->

From the manpage: Socat  is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them&#8230; the streams can be constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources (TCP, UDP, SOCKS, files, processes, pipes, file-descriptors, readline, &#8230;).
