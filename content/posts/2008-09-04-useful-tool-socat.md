A useful tool I've come across (thanks JB) - **socat**. As the [homepage](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/) says, sort of netcat++.

From the manpage: SocatÂ  is a command line based utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them... the streams can be constructed from a large set of different types of data sinks and sources (TCP, UDP, SOCKS, files, processes, pipes, file-descriptors, readline, ...).
