Oops, I&#8217;ve blown my iPhone data usage over Xmas/New Year. Was watching too much pr0n (aka [Brazilian Jiu Jitu competitions][1]).

<!--more-->

The nice Telstra guy gave me a good tip &#8211; disable &#8220;Cellular Data&#8221; and &#8220;Enable 3G&#8221; in my network settings (until my next billing cycle), so as not to really blow out my usage and get a $1000 bill.

The [Apple Discussions forum][2] discusses the difference between the two settings &#8211; it seems disable &#8220;Cellular Data&#8221; stops internet access; disable &#8220;Enable 3G&#8221; forces MMS&#8217;s to be sent via the edge network. But I didn&#8217;t read the page in detail, as I&#8217;ve got lots more [pr0n][3] to watch, from my ADSL connection :-)
