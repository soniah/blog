Oops, I've blown my iPhone data usage over Xmas/New Year. Was watching too much pr0n (aka [Brazilian Jiu Jitu competitions][1]).

<!--more-->

The nice Telstra guy gave me a good tip -- disable "Cellular Data" and "Enable 3G" in my network settings (until my next billing cycle), so as not to really blow out my usage and get a $1000 bill.

The [Apple Discussions forum][2] discusses the difference between the two settings -- it seems disable "Cellular Data" stops internet access; disable "Enable 3G" forces MMS's to be sent via the edge network. But I didn't read the page in detail, as I've got lots more [pr0n][3] to watch, from my ADSL connection :-)
