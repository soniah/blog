Oops, I've blown my iPhone data usage over Xmas/New Year. Was watching too much pr0n (aka [Brazilian Jiu Jitu competitions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-59WlghKYM)).

The nice Telstra guy gave me a good tip - disable "Cellular Data" and "Enable 3G" in my network settings (until my next billing cycle), so as not to really blow out my usage and get a $1000 bill.

The [Apple Discussions forum](http://discussions.info.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=12018583) discusses the difference between the two settings - it seems disable "Cellular Data" stops internet access; disable "Enable 3G" forces MMS's to be sent via the edge network. But I didn't read the page in detail, as I've got lots more [pr0n](http://www.youtube.com/user/RyanHallBJJ) to watch, from my ADSL connection :-)
