KDan (via [Slashdot][1]) has a great post on [how to recognise a good programmer][2]; I think many of his points also apply to system administrators.

<!--more-->

Some of the key points:

  * passionate about technology, will talk your ear off on a technical subject if encouraged; technology isn&#8217;t a day job but a lifestyle
  * learns new technologies on their own, and doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;send me on a course to learn that&#8221;
  * very uncomfortable about the idea of working with a technology they don&#8217;t believe to be “right”
  * has some hidden “icebergs”, large personal projects under the CV radar

All-in-all a really great article -- I suggest you read it.
