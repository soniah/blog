Useful tool: [Monit][1]
<!--more-->

Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses to much resources. You can use monit to monitor files, directories and devices for changes, such as timestamp changes, checksum changes or size changes. You can also monitor remote hosts; monit can ping a remote host and can check TCP/IP port connections and server protocols. 

(Thanks to AndrewMc for this tip).
