I've just setup the venerable [denyhosts](http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/) on one of my servers, to stop the usual script-kiddies from _filling up my logs_ (I'm not particularly worried about them getting in...).

Anyway, here is [restricted-usernames.gz](http://blog.snowfrog.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/restricted-usernames.gz), a list of denied usernames from the log - handy to add to your denyhosts [restricted-usernames file](http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/faq.html#restricted). There's probably a better dictionary of usernames out there - I'll attach it if I <del>find it</del> stumble upon it.
