An interesting [article][1] from [ScienceDaily][2]:

&#8220;Like humans, monkeys benefit enormously from being actively involved in learning instead of having information presented to them passively,&#8221; said Nate Kornell, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in psychology and lead author of the study, which appears in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science. &#8220;The advantage of active learning appears to be a fundamental property of memory in humans and nonhumans alike.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Many people,&#8221; Kornell noted, &#8220;have had the experience of listening to a computer instructor open a menu and go through a series of steps. Then you try to do it, and you don&#8217;t even know which menu or what the first step is. If you are passively following along, *you won&#8217;t remember it as well as if you&#8217;re forced to do it yourself. Active learning is much harder, but if you can do it successfully, you will remember it much better in the long run*.
