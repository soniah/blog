In a similar vein, an article in today's SMH on NSW's health system begins:

&#8220;*A decision had been made, he wrote, to set up a new unit within the emergency department. The unit will be . four beds, conceptually down the right hand wall of ED but using the concept of &#8216;virtual beds',&#8221; he told colleagues. Patients who arrived at emergency and needed admission would be assigned a virtual bed if no official in-patient bed was available, remaining physically in emergency.*&#8220;
