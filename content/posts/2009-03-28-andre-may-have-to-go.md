This financial crisis is forcing companies to make tough decisions, there is a risk that we might need to lay off Andre&#8230;

(Tip-of-the-hat to J).

In a similar vein, an article in today&#8217;s SMH on NSW&#8217;s health system begins:

&#8220;*A decision had been made, he wrote, to set up a new unit within the emergency department&#8230; The unit will be &#8230; four beds, conceptually down the right hand wall of ED but using the concept of &#8216;virtual beds&#8217;,&#8221; he told colleagues. Patients who arrived at emergency and needed admission would be assigned a virtual bed if no official in-patient bed was available, remaining physically in emergency.*&#8220;
