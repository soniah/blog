I recently reinstalled Ubuntu Gutsy on one of my laptops, and the fonts in Firefox came up ugly. I can't remember what I did last time to improve the fonts, but this techniques in [this post](http://blog.rfquerin.org/2008/03/05/ubuntu-firefox-gnome-and-slight-hinting/) made things a bit better. Also checkout [this](http://ubuntusite.com/fix-get-best-firefox-font-linux/) and [this](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=1209754&postcount=1).
