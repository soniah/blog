Here are some useful tools for troubleshooting/recovering windows systems:
<!--more-->

  * look up events at [eventid.net][1] 
  * [Ultimate Boot CD][2] 
  * [Ultimate Boot CD for Windows][3] 
  * [SpinRite][4]. The same guy also has a useful tool called &#8216;Shields Up', and a podcast called [Security Now!][5] 
  * [BootDisks.Com][6] has a collection of prebuilt boot disks you can download 
  * [ERD Commander][7] allows you to repair unbootable or locked-out systems, restore lost data, remove malware from infected systems while the system is safely offline using your existing antivirus software, and diagnose system and network issues 
  * all tools from [Sysinternals.Com][8] 

Linux tools (and *[religion][9]*&#8230;):

  * [Knoppix][10] is a CD bootable Linux distribution, that is *The Swiss Army Chainsaw* of distros -- it does everything. [Insert Linux][11] and [Damn Small Linux][12] are also useful, as they fit on business card CDs 
  * [PNordahl][13] has a tool for resetting forgotten Administrator passwords 
  * [DBAN][14] completely solves all Windows problems, by wiping the hard disk :-) *You can then install a decent Operating System like [Ubuntu Linux][15]* 
  * see also my article on [DD Rescue][16]
