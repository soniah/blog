I&#8217;ve been doing BJJ ([Brazilian Jiu Jitsu][1]) for years. It&#8217;s a great sport and form of self-defence, but in Australia it&#8217;s dominated by men &#8211; probably putting a lot of women off starting.

This is unfortunate, as I think BJJ is one of the best forms of self defence women can do; statistically violence against women is less likely to be the &#8220;pub punchup&#8221; that guys get in and more likely to be a grab/sexual assault (either in public or in the home). In these situations, reflexively knowing how to escape from someone&#8217;s grips or fight on the ground with someone stronger and heavier on top of you is invaluable, and just by training with a stinky, sweaty guy on top of you you&#8217;re much less to likely to panic and escape the situation ([The Bene Gesserit Littany against Fear &#8211; Dune][2]).

But BJJ is also a great sport! You get a great workout (especially abs), it&#8217;s exciting and you need to think a lot (BJJ is often called &#8220;physical chess&#8221;). You share the pain and triumphs, the sweat and exhilaration, the interstate and [overseas trips][3] with your team mates, and form close friendships.

I&#8217;m now training at [The Dojo][4] in Bondi Junction with Daniel Sainty. Amongst the guys there&#8217;s[ 4 other women training][5] &#8211; Eleni, Kunita, Laura and Sam. They&#8217;re all inspirational, but the one who really gets me back to training when my middle-aged joints are creaking is Sam. She&#8217;s a petite high school girl, self-described &#8220;girly-girl&#8221; and geek. She fights against the boys, gives (and receives) a good thrashing, is starting to win competitions, and is now [blogging about her training][6]. You go girl!!

BJJ is so effective that the US Army now uses it as the foundation for their [Army Combatives][7] course. Not because they want their soldiers to throw down their rifles and start up UFC-style fights with &#8220;the baddies&#8221;. Rather, they found that teaching a random collection ofÂ  moves (this kick, this punch, this other kick) was ineffective for learning a &#8220;combat mindset&#8221;. The sport nature of BJJ allows for &#8220;an avenue or the motivation for continued training&#8221; as well as internalizing the &#8220;concept of a hierarchy of dominant positions&#8221;. And knowing how to [rear naked choke][8] when someone jumps on you and hangs on to your rifle is kind of handy&#8230;

See you on the mat sometime :-)
