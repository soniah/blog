Summary:

**$ ssh -fN -L localport:remoteserver:remoteport hopserver**

Optionally combined with agent forwarding and user/hostname mapping in .ssh/config; optionally combined with this in .ssh/config if drilling through a squid proxy:


    
    Host remoteserver
        Hostname remoteserver
        ProxyCommand connect-proxy -S dmzproxy.foo.com:1080 %h %p


**To setup an ssh tunnel (4 machines):**
`
hosta$ ssh -fN`` -o GateWayPorts=yes`` -L P:S:W`` user@B`
` hostc$ some-app A:P
`
-f - go into background after asking for a password
-N - don't execute a remote command
-g - gateway (or **-o GateWayPorts=yes**) - may be required if doing double ssh (ie one tunnel feeding in to a second tunnel); **will** be required to allow connections to forwarded port from external hosts (ie not localhost)

Data between C and A _won't_ be encrypted; data between A and B _will_ be encrypted; data between B and S _won't_ be encrypted.

**To setup an ssh tunnel (3 machines):**

If Host C and Host A are the _same machine_:
`
hosta$ ssh -fN -L P:S:W user@B`
` hosta$ some-app A:P`

If Host B and Host S are the _same machine_:

` hosta$ ssh -fN -o GateWayPorts=yes -L P:B:W user@B`
` hostc$ some-app A:P`

**To setup an ssh tunnel (2 machines):**

Another common case is where both C and A, and B and S, are the same machines - call them _local_ and _remote_. There are 2 possible commands:
`
local$ ssh -fN -L P:localhost:W remote
local$ ssh -fN -L P:remote:W remote
`
Both will usually work, but to the destination server (1) appears to come from 127.0.0.1 and (2) appears to come from remote's ip. (1) would give "connection refused" errors if connections aren't allowed from localhost (unusual), (2) would give "connection refused" errors if connections aren't allowed from anything but localhost (eg typically mysql).

To connect, do **ssh -p P foo@localhost**. Be aware of account name issues ie localhost and remote are different hosts, so a tunnel may succeed but then the ssh command fail due to account name mismatches - hence the **foo@**localhost.

**Some tricks from [this article](http://polishlinux.org/apps/ssh-tunneling-to-bypass-corporate-firewalls/):**

`$ ssh user@intermediate-server -D 8080 # setup a pseudo socks server; point socks-able apps at localhost:8080`
