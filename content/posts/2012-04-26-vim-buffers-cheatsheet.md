A small Vim Buffers cheatsheet:

<!--more-->

    :bu <tab>    - select a buffer
    :buN         - select buffer N
    :ls          - list buffers
    :sb tab      - split screen on another buffer
    :sbN         - split screen on buffer N
    :only        - make this the only buffer (ie maximise)
    ^w^o         - make this the only buffer (ie maximise)
    :ball        - split screen on all buffers
    :hide        - hide this buffer
    :bdel        - remove buffer from list


Vim buffers don't seem as flexible as the Emacs equivalent, but then _nothing_ is as flexible as Emacs:
