<tt>> But anything worthy of going into ${ubuntu_release}-updates is surely</tt>  
<tt>> worth putting straight into ${ubuntu_release} ? Or is it just me?</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt>Post-release, that archive is never touched. It means that users get to</tt>  
<tt>choose how much damage they're willing to accept:</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt> * release: Don't touch it, I like consistency, even with my bugs.</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt> * release-security: I'll accept patches to existing versions (and very</tt>  
<tt> rare version upgrades if absolutely necessary) in the process of keeping</tt>  
<tt> my system secure.</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt> * release-updates: Okay, some bugs are worth fixing, and I trust you this</tt>  
<tt> much (holds up two fingers like Maxwell Smart).</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt> * release-backports: I have something akin to technology ADHD, needing</tt>  
<tt> the latest of everything I can possibly get, but I'm a sooky little</tt>  
<tt> wuss-fart because I can't handle running the development branch.</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt> * devel: I can take it. Seriously. If you break my X, I shall become more</tt>  
<tt> powerful than you could possibly imagine. I'll file and maybe even fix</tt>  
<tt> the bugs and I'll do it even if power management is not so much 'managed'</tt>  
<tt> as vomited all over the wall. Come get some.</tt>  
<tt></tt>  
<tt> * debian: We do the work so you don't have to.</tt>
