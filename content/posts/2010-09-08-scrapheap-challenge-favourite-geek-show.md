My favourite geek show -- Scrapheap Challenge -- 6.30pm weekdays on ABC2.

<!--more-->

Two teams are let loose in a junkyard and they compete to build a something within 12 hours eg a engine propelled boat, a rocket, a diving suit. Second favourite -- Mythbusters of course.

Having a PVR makes these easy to record and watch at better times&#8230;
