My favourite geek show - Scrapheap Challenge - 6.30pm weekdays on ABC2. Two teams are let loose in a junkyard and they compete to build a something within 12 hours eg a engine propelled boat, a rocket, a diving suit. Second favourite - Mythbusters of course.

Having a PVR makes these easy to record and watch at better times...
