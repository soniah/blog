I stumbled across a <s>limitation</s> <s>feature</s> behaviour of Solaris over the weekend &#8211; by default it only allows you to run a maximum of 100 cron jobs at once. I suppose this to protect against &#8220;shooting oneself in the head&#8221;, but aaaarghhh&#8230; Reminds me why I love Monday mornings.

<!--more-->

Anyway, the file to edit is **/etc/cron.d/queuedefs**, see **man queuedefs**.

Thanks to [Solaris Tips][1] for pointing me in the right direction.
