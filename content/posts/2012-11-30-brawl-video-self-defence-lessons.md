This brawl video shows some good self defence lessons. Chest pushing -> wild punching -> shirt,hair,standup grappling -> ground grappling ie Muay Thai -> Wrestling -> BJJ.

But that you don't want to get stuck grappling - someone else can then come and punch/kick you in the head...

Lot's of people were hurt, but imagine if improvised weapons (beer bottles, bricks) had been used - even worse... :-( And like most fights, any of them could have just "counted to 10" and walked away - always the best approach :-)
