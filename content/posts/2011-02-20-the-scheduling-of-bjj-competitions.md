I participated in another [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu][1] (BJJ) competition today (the [Abu Dhabi trials][2]).

<!--more-->

I won a match (happy face) and lost a match (sad face), which was disappointing &#8211; otherwise I would&#8217;ve been flying off to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Professional Jiu Jitsu Championships next month &#8211; only 3 women in my weight bracket.

But what was really disappointing was the typical disorganisation of the event ie it was running hours late. This is really frustrating as a competitor &#8211; you don&#8217;t know when to eat, when to start warming up, or even what time to turn up. Given that these events can run from 9am to 8pm, it&#8217;s a long day in a hot gymnasium.

*Warning: (simple) arithmetic ahead&#8230;<!--more-->*

It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to work out the scheduling of these events, it&#8217;s a simple arithmetic calculation, why can&#8217;t the organisers get it right? This is how long it takes to run a bracket at an event:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>number of fights  X  duration of each fight  X  a fudge factor</strong>
</p>

For example:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>7 fights  X 5 mins per fight X 1.2 (fudge factor) = 42 minutes</strong>
</p>

## The fudge factor

What is the &#8220;fudge factor&#8221;? It is simply the extra time you add to each fight to allow for the fact that fights aren&#8217;t going to run immediately one after another. I&#8217;ve guessed 1.2, but you might allow 1.4 or even 1.6 for a busy competition. Put another way, fights are supposed to last 5 minutes (or 6-10 minutes), but only two things make them shorter:

  * a withdrawal or no-show by a competitor
  * a fight finishing early due to a tap out

However, these things make each fight last longer:

  * weigh ins
  * mats are empty while a new bracket starts
  * mats are empty while judges get ready (or go missing!)
  * mats are empty while judges have to chase up competitors
  * time outs &#8211; competitors pushed off mats, redoing kimono, etc
  * injuries requiring medical assistance
  * and the general time wasting that goes on at competitions

So, I&#8217;ve erred towards a longer fudge factor (>1) rather than a shorter fudge factor (<1).

## How Many Fights?

If you&#8217;ve got 8 competitors in a &#8220;[sudden death tournament][3]&#8220;, how many fights will there be? Google gives the [answer][4]:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>N-1</strong>
</p>

ie for 8 competitors, there will be 7 fights. That was hard&#8230;**

## A ready reckoner

Given that most people dislike arithmetic, here&#8217;s a table that allows you to look up how long a 5 minute fight bracket will take in hours and minutes, for a given number of competitors and a given fudge factor. Notice how with a fudge factor of 1.2, it only takes 11 competitors for a bracket to last 1 hour. And it explains why today&#8217;s tournament was so late, they only allowed 1.5 hours for 51 competitors instead of 5 hours&#8230;
