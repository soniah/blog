I've just got a new MSR Whisperlite International Stove, as I couldn't find a replacement fuel bottle for my old Coleman petrol stove.

The adapter for my old Coleman is the same diameter as the current fuel
bottles, but a different thread pitch :-(

Here's a list of the different fuels the MSR accepts, as well as the names of these fuels in different countries. There is also good information at the bottom of [Zen Stoves' Petrol Burning Stoves page](http://zenstoves.net/Petrol.htm#Fuels).


    Australia:     Shellite,                    Unleaded Petrol,     Kerosene
    Spain:         Bencina Blanca,              Gasolina sin Plomo,  Parafina
    France:        Petrole a bruler/Essence C,  Essence sans Plomb,  Kerosene
    Netherlands:   Wasbenzine,                  Benzine,             Petroleum Lampolie
    Germany/Switz: Kocherbenzin/Reinbenzin,     Autobenzin,          Petroleum
    Japan:         White Gas,                   Gasoline,            Toy-yu
