I use ssh to tunnel all the time, especially to get around brain-dead firewalls. But this doesn't work easily for mysql - if you tunnel a port from localhost (eg localhost:3306) to the target db, mysql client tools will see 'localhost' and try to connect via the local socket. Very broken - there's bugs lodged [here](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27361) and [here](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=31577) about this (and lots of chest beating and wailing, too).

**Solution:** tunnel ssh via an intermediate machine. For example:

    
    intermediate$ ssh -o GatewayPorts=yes -L 3306:targetdb:3306 targetdb
    localhost$ mysql -h intermediate -P 3306


GatewayPorts - dangerous yes - but so is life...

**Update**

The problem seems to have been fixed; either that or I was having a very blond moment last time I tried using **- - protocol**.

    
    localhost$ mysql --version
    localhost$ mysqlÂ  Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.0.51a, for debian-linux-gnu (i486) using readline 5.2
    localhost$ ssh -fN -L3306:targetdb:3306 targetdb
    localhost$ mysql --protocol=tcp -hlocalhost -uroot
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 14788104
    Server version: 4.0.21-Max-log
    Type 'help;' or 'h' for help. Type 'c' to clear the buffer.
    mysql>


**Update 2**

However graphical tools like OpenOffice Base, GMySqlCC and MySQL Query Browser either don't obey the - - protocol=tcp flag or don't have a place to set it, and therefore try to connect via the local socket file when connecting to localhost. Aarghhhhh....

**Update 3**

Using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost works for OpenOffice - yay.
