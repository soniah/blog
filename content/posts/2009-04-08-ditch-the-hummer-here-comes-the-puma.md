An article in today&#8217;s SMH &#8211; [Ditch the Hummer, here comes the PUMA][1] &#8211; along with a jaunty photo of metrosexual darting through traffic. Looks like it combines the disadvantages of a car (cost, need to fuel, too heavy to put on your shoulder) with the disadvantages of a bicycle (cold/hot, wet, you actually work up a sweat) without the fun of a motorcycle (speed &#8211; yeh baby!).

Yawn. I&#8217;ll stick to my bicycle/car/dreams of hopping back on a motorbike. And keep using public transport whenever I can.
