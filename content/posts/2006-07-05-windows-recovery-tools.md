Here are some useful tools for troubleshooting/recovering windows systems:








  * look up events at [eventid.net](http://www.eventid.net)

  * [Ultimate Boot CD](http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/)

  * [Ultimate Boot CD for Windows](http://www.ubcd4win.com/)

  * [SpinRite](http://www.grc.com/spinrite.htm). The same guy also has a useful tool called 'Shields Up', and a podcast called [Security Now!](http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm)


  * [BootDisks.Com](http://bootdisks.com/) has a collection of prebuilt boot disks you can download

  * [ERD Commander](http://www.winternals.com/Products/ERDCommander/) allows you to repair unbootable or locked-out systems, restore lost data, remove malware from infected systems while the system is safely offline using your existing antivirus software, and diagnose system and network issues

  * all tools from [Sysinternals.Com](http://sysinternals.com/)





Linux tools (and _[religion](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/religious-issues.html)_...):








  * [Knoppix](http://www.knoppix.org/) is a CD bootable Linux distribution, that is _The Swiss Army Chainsaw_ of distros - it does everything. [Insert Linux](http://www.inside-security.de/insert_en.html) and [Damn Small Linux](http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/) are also useful, as they fit on business card CDs

  * [PNordahl](http://home.eunet.no/pnordahl/ntpasswd/) has a tool for resetting forgotten Administrator passwords


  * [DBAN](http://dban.sourceforge.net/) completely solves all Windows problems, by wiping the hard disk :-) _You can then install a decent Operating System like [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/)_
