      <div class="meta">11 Dec 2013</div>
    </header>

    I get by in a few foreign languages (Spanish mostly, some Portuguese and French). People&rsquo;s first response to this is &ldquo;oh that sounds so hard&rdquo; quickly followed by &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to learn languageX next year&rdquo;. As if learning is a language is something you can quickly tick off your bucket list, to be followed by &ldquo;go sky diving&rdquo;, &ldquo;see the Pyramids&rdquo; and &ldquo;walk Kokoda&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s always more to learn in a foreign language, and sitting down and doing grammar and exercises is boring.

    I&rsquo;ve just got a new MSR Whisperlite International Stove, as I couldn&rsquo;t find a replacement fuel bottle for my old Coleman petrol stove. The adapter for my old Coleman is the same diameter as the current fuel bottles, but a different thread pitch :-( Here&rsquo;s a list of the different fuels the MSR accepts, as well as the names of these fuels in different countries. There is also good information at the bottom of Zen Stoves&rsquo; Petrol Burning Stoves page.

    From the Wall Street Journal: MADRID—Weekend elections that threaten to drive Spain&#8217;s ruling Socialist party from power in several regions and cities also promise a potentially nasty surprise: the revelation of piles of undisclosed debt in local governments that could undercut the country&#8217;s drive to avoid an international bailout And in Spanish (El Pais): Iceland arrives in Spain at 15/May demo Arrancó primero Nolesvotes, una iniciativa que insta a evitar llenar las urnas de papeletas de PP, PSOE y CiU acusándoles de aprovecharse de la ley electoral para perpetuarse en el Parlamento con unos &#8220;niveles de corrupción en España alarmantes&#8221;.

    I&#8217;ve noticed that most of the time I&#8217;m happy with ebooks/webpages for learning a new technology. But when it&#8217;s something difficult or something I really want to grok, I like to print things out or best of all buy a book (and then curl up on the couch and just read and annotate). Maybe I&#8217;m not the only one &#8211; O&#8217;Reilly Radar has an article about a study that suggests university students learn better with paper books.

    Oops, I&#8217;ve blown my iPhone data usage over Xmas/New Year. Was watching too much pr0n (aka Brazilian Jiu Jitu competitions). The nice Telstra guy gave me a good tip &#8211; disable &#8220;Cellular Data&#8221; and &#8220;Enable 3G&#8221; in my network settings (until my next billing cycle), so as not to really blow out my usage and get a $1000 bill. The Apple Discussions forum discusses the difference between the two settings &#8211; it seems disable &#8220;Cellular Data&#8221; stops internet access; disable &#8220;Enable 3G&#8221; forces MMS&#8217;s to be sent via the edge network.

    My favourite geek show &#8211; Scrapheap Challenge &#8211; 6.30pm weekdays on ABC2. Two teams are let loose in a junkyard and they compete to build a something within 12 hours eg a engine propelled boat, a rocket, a diving suit. Second favourite &#8211; Mythbusters of course. Having a PVR makes these easy to record and watch at better times&#8230;

    Great film &#8211; &#8220;Four Lions&#8221;. It&#8217;s about four would-be Jihadi&#8217;s from England trying to reach heaven by blowing up something big &#8211; eg the local chemist. The only problem is that these guys are *stupid, out-and-out muppets *&#8211; think suicide crow-bombs, guys eating (and choking on) their SIM card to &#8220;evade detection&#8221;, secret messages between animated puffins, idiots with Cornish accents arguing over who is &#8220;more Jihadi&#8221;, &#8230; Seriously funny.

    I&#8217;ve always wondered what recruitment agents use as their formula to convert between salaries and contract rates. Here&#8217;s a formula (for giving ballpark figures) &#8211; thanks CK: Salary divided by 48 weeks, divided by 40 hours, plus 20% (super, training, sick leave, etc) =~ Hourly rate For example, $100K =~ $62.50/hour, $150K =~ $93.75/hour. Here&#8217;s a quick ready reckoner &#8211; handy to print out when you&#8217;re doing the &#8220;job mambo&#8221;:

    Last night I attended the second cultural activity of the Cervantes Institute &#8211; a Flamenco Guitar Masterclass put on by a giant of the flamenco world Óscar Herrero, with the assistance of David Rasko and students from the Sydney Spanish Guitar Studio. There were a large number of attendees (about 50) as well as many guitars, and we all had a great time. Óscar talked us through a brief history of flamenco and explained how a flamenco guitar differs from a classical guitar.

    The Spanish Language Institute (Instituto Cervantes) has just opened in Sydney. The Institute has a similar role to that of the French Alliance Francaise &#8211; to encourage the spread of Spanish language and culture throughout the world. Last night was the first night of the advanced class &#8211; we started late as none of us had thought to order our textbooks and the poor teacher had to improvise, but there was also an opening of an exhibition of Peruvian photography so we had red wine and tapas on our break and then proceeded to have a great time in the second half of the class (all typically Spanish).

    Another year, another Sydney Film Festival. Two films I saw really stood out &#8211; The Cove (about the continued Japanese dolphin slaughter) and Che Part I and Part II (covering the Cuban and Bolivian years of Ernesto &#8216;Che&#8217; Guevara). Also memorable was Big River Man, about a middle aged Slovenian man who swims the entire length of the Amazon river. Like always (this is my approx 15th festival), I start the festival with feelings of both anticipation and trepidation &#8211; anticipation that I&#8217;ll see some great films, and trepidation at the long nights and weekends in the dark, followed by getting up in the morning for work :-) But there&#8217;s nothing like seeing a great movie with several thousand other cineastes in the splendour of the State Theatre to renew my love of good cinema.

    An article in today&#8217;s SMH &#8211; Ditch the Hummer, here comes the PUMA &#8211; along with a jaunty photo of metrosexual darting through traffic. Looks like it combines the disadvantages of a car (cost, need to fuel, too heavy to put on your shoulder) with the disadvantages of a bicycle (cold/hot, wet, you actually work up a sweat) without the fun of a motorcycle (speed &#8211; yeh baby!). Yawn. I&#8217;ll stick to my bicycle/car/dreams of hopping back on a motorbike.

    This financial crisis is forcing companies to make tough decisions, there is a risk that we might need to lay off Andre&#8230; Andre may have to go... (Tip-of-the-hat to J). In a similar vein, an article in today&#8217;s SMH on NSW&#8217;s health system begins: &#8220;A decision had been made, he wrote, to set up a new unit within the emergency department&#8230; The unit will be &#8230; four beds, conceptually down the right hand wall of ED but using the concept of &#8216;virtual beds&#8217;,&#8221; he told colleagues.

    &#8220;RailCorp is threatening a Sydney man with legal action after he created an iPhone application that allows people to monitor timetables for Sydney trains and ferries.&#8221; &#8211; from today&#8217;s SMH. The author (Alvin Singh) is currently working for News Digital, so RailCorp probably can&#8217;t contract him out for a few months or offer him a monetary payment for the app (which he has offered to RailCorp for free). How about accepting his offer of the code and giving him a yearly train pass&#8230;?

    An interesting article from ScienceDaily: &#8220;Like humans, monkeys benefit enormously from being actively involved in learning instead of having information presented to them passively,&#8221; said Nate Kornell, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar in psychology and lead author of the study, which appears in the August issue of the journal Psychological Science. &#8220;The advantage of active learning appears to be a fundamental property of memory in humans and nonhumans alike.&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;Many people,&#8221; Kornell noted, &#8220;have had the experience of listening to a computer instructor open a menu and go through a series of steps.
