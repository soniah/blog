But that you don&rsquo;t want to get stuck grappling - someone else can then come and punch/kick you in the head&hellip; Lot&rsquo;s of people were hurt, but imagine if improvised weapons (beer bottles, bricks) had been used - even worse&hellip; :-( And like

    Learning Arnis is great, but what do you do when someone is running at you swinging a weapon? Here we&rsquo;re practising charging - both attacking and defending. We&rsquo;re still getting the hang of it, so we&rsquo;re going slowly and counting out the number of steps we take.

    John Russell and I went to Darwin for a week, to escape the winter cold in Sydney. While we were training on Darwin Wharf (nice cool sea-breeze), a Filipino man Ely Baera asked if he could play. He&rsquo;s from Melbourne and learned his Balintawak from GM Vincente Sanchez and at Lighting Scientific. Thanks for training with us Ely! [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDWEBtbM7xk]

    I&#8217;ve setup a new Meetup.com group called Sydney Stick Fighting. It&#8217;s early days yet, I&#8217;m still gathering email addresses and getting people to join up. Here&#8217;s the description of the group: A group for practitioners of the Filipino art of Balintawak Arnis (stick fighting). Arnis (also known as Esgrima or Kali) is a very practical martial art that involves sticks, striking, grappling or improvised weapons. It is becoming more popular (for example the Jason Bourne movies or other movies) and is usually practiced outdoors rather than in a gym.

    Results from the BJJ competition, Sat 5/Mar in Brisbane. I&#8217;ve left this too long, so a quick post. Also: Laura&#8217;s post &#8211; 2011 Queensland State Championships results My first grapple (no-gi) I submitted my opponent (Cara Johnson) by footlock in about 15 seconds, got declared the winner, then got disqualified a few minutes later by the head referee! (making Cara the winner) Reason being I rolled inwards on the footlock rather than outwards, thus putting unnecessary pressure on her knee (as you can see below.

      <div class="meta">Thu, Mar 3, 2011</div>
    </header>

    <p>I competed in the [BJJ][1] [Abu Dhabi Pro Australian Qualifier][2] on the 19th of February in Sydney. I won my first fight and lost my second fight. A pity, otherwise I would&#8217;ve been flying off to Abu Dhabi to compete!</p>

<p>The first fight. I gave in too easily to her pull to guard, and then took a while getting out. But then I passed to reverse half guard, half guard, side control, and back.</p>

<p><span class="youtube"></span></p>

<p>The second fight. I made the error of trying a flying armbar from standup, which went badly. I ended up stuck under a cross-face half guard. I should&#8217;ve been able to get out of this, it&#8217;s a beginner escape. But as they say, you always learn the most when you lose in competitions; since the comp I&#8217;ve been focusing on this escape&#8230;</p>

      <div class="meta">Sat, Feb 19, 2011</div>
    </header>

    <p>I participated in another [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu]<a href="BJJ">1</a> competition today (the [Abu Dhabi trials][2]). I won a match (happy face) and lost a match (sad face), which was disappointing &#8211; otherwise I would&#8217;ve been flying off to Abu Dhabi to compete in the World Professional Jiu Jitsu Championships next month &#8211; only 3 women in my weight bracket.</p>

<p>But what was really disappointing was the typical disorganisation of the event ie it was running hours late. This is really frustrating as a competitor &#8211; you don&#8217;t know when to eat, when to start warming up, or even what time to turn up. Given that these events can run from 9am to 8pm, it&#8217;s a long day in a hot gymnasium.</p>

<p>*Warning: (simple) arithmetic ahead&#8230;</p>

    I&#8217;m sporting a nice black eye at the moment from BJJ. It&#8217;s not actually one black eye but three, all received in the last week. The first one was a jab in the eye at the Victorian (Australia) state competition last week (which I won). Then a few days later Eric (the feisty Judo black belt I like to tangle with) accidentally elbowed me &#8211; instant shiner. Then the following day Eleni accidentally scratched the same eye &#8211; ouch!

      <div class="meta">Tue, Feb 9, 2010</div>
    </header>

    I&#8217;ve been doing BJJ (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) for years. It&#8217;s a great sport and form of self-defence, but in Australia it&#8217;s dominated by men &#8211; probably putting a lot of women off starting. This is unfortunate, as I think BJJ is one of the best forms of self defence women can do; statistically violence against women is less likely to be the &#8220;pub punchup&#8221; that guys get in and more likely to be a grab/sexual assault (either in public or in the home).

    This weekend I had a BJJ competition &#8211; the &#8220;6th Annual Australian Submission Grappling Championships&#8221; (what a mouthful) &#8211; here are some videos from the weekend. The competition went all day and I didn&#8217;t get as many videos as usual as I was one of the officials too (table scorer). *(For those of you who don&#8217;t know what [BJJ][1] is (Brazilian Jiu Jitsu) &#8211; here&#8217;s a short history: at the start of 1900&#8217;s in Japan ** Judo split off as a sport from the more traditional Japanese warrior arts or Jiu-Jitsu.

    I&#8217;ve just had a week off work &#8211; bliss. I spent the first few days relaxing and recovering from a cold that&#8217;s been dogging me for about 3 weeks. Then I&#8217;ve been training BJJ everyday, or sometimes twice a day, and eating, sleeping and stretching the rest of each day. What more could one want in life? A few minor injuries, mostly from $%^&amp;#@! male newbies &#8211; they fight using power not technique, and especially hate being submitted by women.
